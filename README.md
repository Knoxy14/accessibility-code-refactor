HOMEWORK

Hello  my name is Derek, I was hired on by Horiseon to help improve your existing code and make it run smoother, and easier to read.
Below I will state exactly where I changed code in your CSS and provide the exacte line number.

First off with the CSS. I will be listing everything that was grouped together for a more neat and easier to manage look!

LINE 94 - .benefit-lead h3, .benefit-brand h3, .benefit-cost h3 {
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    text-align: center;
    
LINE 99 - .benefit-lead img, .benefit-brand img, .benefit-cost img {
    display: block;
    margin: 10px auto;
    max-width: 150px;
    
LINE 105 - .search-engine-optimization, .online-reputation-management, .social-media-marketing {
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    padding: 50px;
    height: 300px;
    font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;
    background-color: #0072bb;
    color: #ffffff;
    
LINE 114 - .search-engine-optimization img, .online-reputation-management img, .social-media-marketing img {
    max-height: 200px;
    
LINE 118 - .search-engine-optimization h2, .online-reputation-management h2, .social-media-marketing h2 {
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    font-size: 36px;
    
    Next up HTML, we changed the titles for better accessibility feautures.
